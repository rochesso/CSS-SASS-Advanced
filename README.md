# CSS-SASS-Advanced

Each branch is a project from the course "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!" completed by me at Udemy. The projects were coded-along with the instructor.

I completed the "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!" course on Udemy and as part of the program, I designed and implemented some comprehensive projects. These projects effectively demonstrates my ability to produce fluid website designs using CSS and SCSS, while adhering closely to original mockups and delivering a visually stunning final product.
